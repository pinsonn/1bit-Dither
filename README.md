1-Bit Dither is a HTML5 canvas based web application to experiment with 1-bit dithered images. 
The ultimate goal in developing this application was to define a general enough framework 
to allow end users to easily define and use whatever error diffusion technique/filter they 
like and quickly see the results. This project was inspired by the work of Evil Mad Scientist
Laboratories (http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2012/dithering/) and the resources linked therein.
